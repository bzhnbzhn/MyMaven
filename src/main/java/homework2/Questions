Question 1
The following code creates one array and one string object.
1. How many references to those objects exist after the code executes?
2. Is either object eligible for garbage collection?

String[] students = new String[10];
String studentName = "Peter Parker";
students[0] = studentName;
studentName = null;

1. 2 reference exist
String[] students = new String[10];
and
String studentName = "Peter Parker".

2. No, any
String[] students = new String[10]; - has 1 reference to object studentName
students[0] = studentName; - has a refers to studentName.



Question 2
How does a program destroy an object that it creates?

Program does not destroy objects.
But, an object can be released to make it a candidate for Garbage Collection:
 - By making a reference null;
 - By assigning a reference to another;
 - By using an anonymous object.
